This is a fork of JACC (Just Another Component Creator) 3.0.0-r179, a Joomla! component to create Joomla! extension.
This component is excellent, however we still need to do some customizations to suite of needs, that is why we fork it and put it here as a back-up. "Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it." - Linus Torvalds

If you are going to use this fork, you are on your own, we do not provide any support for it, please use the original component instead.
